## Our Mission

Agile software development is undeniably a dynamic, exciting working environment. But when we're building teams and delivering projects, our focus tends to be on deliverables ("When can we ship it?") and metrics ("How can we deliver more work faster?")

What tends to get left by the wayside is the _people_ (so often referred to coldly as our "resources"). As we deliver sprint after sprint of work - or, when teams are stretched, sometimes asking people to split themselves across multiple teams simultaneously - the human cost is frequently ignored. Stress, exhaustion, burnout and depression are a constant risk factor, and yet team members constantly defer lunch breaks and holidays, as there's always "just one more critical thing" which needs to be completed first.

At Mojovation Consulting, we want to help individuals and organisations to excel at agile development, but to show care and respect for themselves and their colleagues along the way. By enabling people to be their authentic selves in the workplace, and to recognise and celebrate their diversity, you can ensure that your high-performing teams are also sustainable and flourishing.

<img src="/assets/img/avatar.jpg"  style="float: right; border-radius: 50%; padding-left: 4pt;"/>In almost 20 years of working with agile teams, Neil Studd has worn many hats. He specialises in quality practices, agile coaching and management. Throughout this time, he has practised an empathetic and humanist approach to building and leading teams, and working with senior managers to ensure that the needs of individuals are being met. He is a Certified Scrum Master, a qualified Mental Health First Aider, and a budding author (who's hoping to convert much of the material on these pages into a published book by 2023).

Before discovering a joy for testing, Neil was a journalism graduate, and he still displays this passion through a variety of media enterprises. Since 2017, he's hosted the [Testers' Island Discs podcast](http://www.testersislanddiscs.com), a monthly show where he interviews personalities from the testing industry about their careers, specialisms and musical tastes. He also co-hosts the [Tech Team Weekly](https://www.techteamweekly.com) show on YouTube, discussing the latest in UK technology news and how it affects our working lives.

<br/>Neil has given a variety of talks and workshops at meetups and conferences around the world, including TestBash Philadelphia and Brighton, and the Nordic Testing Days conference in Tallinn. In pandemic times, he launched a YouTube series entitled [Let's Explore!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXltAXX6_L-UMiSlLIilXa8fXiRiRz3dE), an unscripted series which aims to demystify some of the day-to-day activities of engineers and testers, by taking a "trial and error" approach to coding challenges.

Neil is a keen [Peloton enthusiast](/peloton) (he's taken {% include format-thousand-separators.html number=peloton_rides %} cycle rides, covering {% include format-thousand-separators.html number=peloton_mileage %} miles), a curator of Spotify playlists, and environmentalist. In partnership with [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com/neilstudd), Neil has so far planted {{ site.data.ecologi.trees }} trees, and offset {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset }} tonnes of carbon. (That's the equivalent of {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset | divided_by: 1.3 | floor }} long-haul flights, or {% include format-thousand-separators.html number=ecologi_mileage %} miles driven in a car, or saving {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset | times: 3 | round }}m<sup>2</sup> of sea ice.) 🌳
